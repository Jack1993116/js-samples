# Samples for Javascript/Web implementations

This is a [sample website](https://mapsindoors.github.io/js-samples) that demonstrates the common use cases like mapping, search & directions in MapsIndoors Javascript SDK. Please not that the demonstrated SDK is still in beta. 

See the [source code for the sample here](https://github.com/MapsIndoors/js-samples).

You are free to copy this code and use it in your projects, just remember that you need to [generate your own Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
